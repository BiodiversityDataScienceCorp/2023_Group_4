### A paragraph about a favorite species from each of us:
Sydney: My favorite species is the Northern Leopard frog, which are found in Idaho. Recently the population has been declining significantly, which isn't great and I hope to make a change. One time I saw a bunch of baby northern leopard frogs on a backpacking trip, and it was super cool. They have lots of awesome color variations. 
Olivia:My favorite species is sea otters! Growing up I loved watching them play in kelp beds along the beach and hold holds while slepping! They are currently endangered due mostly to direct conflict with humans, like fishing gear entanglements and boat strikes, but oil spills, pollution, disease and loss of kelp are the largest contributers to sea otters population declines. In addition to being aborable because sea otters consume large quantities of marine invertebrates, they play a significant role in nearshore marine ecosystems, enhancing kelp forests and seagrass beds
