### A paragraph about a favorite species from each of us:
Sydney: My favorite species is the Northern Leopard frog, which are found in Idaho. Recently the population has been declining significantly, which isn't great and I hope to make a change. One time I saw a bunch of baby northern leopard frogs on a backpacking trip, and it was super cool. They have lots of awesome color variations.
